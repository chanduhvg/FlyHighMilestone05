**Project Organization**

Organizational Boundaries and Interfaces:

The observed structure is the organizational structure for our project. The authority is given hierarchical wise. Each person is given authority to his area of work and needs to report to the person who is in a level above him.

Project Responsibilities:

The main responsibility of the project is to deliver on time and with the expected quality. Project manager shall coordinate between the team lead, business analysts, administrator for the main domains of the project to work smoothly. The team lead shall have a report of working of the software developer and tester.

**Management and Technical Processes**

**Management Processes:**

Management Objectives and Priorities:

Management is involved at various level while delivering a product. The topmost priority is to deliver a quality product within the given budget and time. Management decides if a change request should be approved or not and keeps a check on the monthly status.

Assumptions, Dependencies, and Constraints:

We assume that the application has no other special accommodations unless specified by the client. The mobile application is dependent on the web portal. The project should satisfy the triple constraints: scope, quality and time.

Risk Management:

The risk should be identified at a root level to avoid any other further affects due to the risk. To handle the risk, the risk management team should come up with upgraded strategies and mitigation plans.

Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms:

This phase is essential to monitor and control few of the processes to keep them under check. The deliverables will be monitored for quality, functionality and scope of the project.

Staffing Plan:

All the staff included for project are from various domains and areas of expertise like database administrator, testing, data analyst, software developer and project manager.

**Technical Processes:**

Methods, Tools, and Techniques:

The Application is developed in both Android and iOS. The technologies used are HTML, JavaScript, and PL/SQL-Oracle 11c. The most important tools are Microsoft Office Suite, Android Studio and Visual studio.

## Quality Management Plan

**Date: May 28, 2020**

**Project Name: E-Pharma**

**Introduction:**

_Many people joke about the poor quality of IT products People seem to accept systems being down occasionally or needing to reboot there, PCs But quality is very important in many IT projects_ Project _SRK Technologies is a software development Company that focuses on developing quality check applications for various clients. The company has currently acquired the project to develop quality check equipment which can use by mobile application. The client has asked SRK Technologies to develop a mobile application where you can buy medicines required online by uploading prescription in the application_ managers are ultimately responsible for quality management on their projects

Several organizations and references can help project managers and their teams understand quality

  - International Organization for Standardization (www.iso.org)
  - IEEE (www.ieee.org)

**Quality Standards:**

_The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines quality as &quot;the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements&quot; (ISO9000:2000)_

_Other experts define quality based on:_

  - _Conformance to requirements: The project&#39;s processes and products meet written specifications_
  - _Fitness for use: A product can be used as it was intended_

_Project quality management ensures that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken_

  - Identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project and how to satisfy them; a **metric** 
  is a standard of measurement

  - Performing quality assurance periodically evaluating overall project performance to ensure the project will satisfy the relevant quality standards

  - Performing quality control monitoring specific project results to ensure that they comply with the relevant quality standards

**Metrics:**

It is used for measuring different factors like performance, productivity, quality, etc.

The measurement generated in this particular project management tool is an actual value. It also sets a tolerance value that defines the allowable variations on the metric. For instance, if the objective stays within the budget by ± 20%, the quality metric is used to measure the cost of the deliverable to determine the percentage variance from the budget.

The use of quality metrics in the control quality process and quality assurance. Examples of the quality metrics include [cost](https://project-management-knowledge.com/definitions/c/cost-control/) control, on-time performance, failure rate and defect frequency.

**Problem Reporting and Corrective Action Process:**

Project managers have the immense task of juggling requirements and resources that are often not under their direct control in order to produce the required project deliverables within the limited constraints to which they must adhere (scope, time, quality, etc.).

Even if the perfect project plan could be designed and executed, it would not remove all of the risks that could ultimately impact a project. Plans must inevitably change for one reason or another.

During the phases of a project, it could be said that there are three major activities focused on reducing project risk. The first risk reduction activity occurs during project planning, when a proactive risk assessment is conducted and the identified risks are either mitigated or avoided (e.g., by modifying the project plan), transferred (such as through insurance) or accepted (by doing nothing and accepting that &quot;if it happens, it happens&quot;).

The second activity is the continual assessment of risk throughout the project. The final risk reduction activity is to hold a retrospective &quot;lessons learned&quot; at the end of the project, which will have the least impact on the current project but will serve to benefit others in the future.

**Supplier Quality and Control:**

_A control chart is a graphic display of data that illustrates the results of a process over time. The main use of control charts is to prevent defects, rather than to detect or reject them. Quality control charts allow you to determine whether a process is in control or out of control. When a process is in control, any variations in the results of the process are created by random events; processes that are in control do not need to be adjusted. When a process is out of control, variations in the results of the process are caused by non-random events; you need to identify the causes of those non-random events and adjust the process to correct or eliminate them_

1. **Glossary of common terminology:**

Stakeholder – An individual, group or an organization, who may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity or outcome of a project.

Escalation – Escalation in project management is an anticipated rise in uncommitted costs of resources (labor, material, equipment) over time, due to reduced purchasing power of money.


## Risk Management Plan

**05/28/2020**

**Project Name:** E-Pharma

**1. Methodology:**

Risk management methodology is set to help, teach, and decrease project risks within our project. The risk model is based on the presence of one or more causes with a remote probability of conflict and one or more effects that will rise due to the existence of the event. In practice, both the known and unknown risks are marked with a reactive strategy.

**2. Roles and responsibilities:**

Project Manager Role is to sign and approve the Risk Management Plan, determine the risk management strategy, engage in the risk management method, and get control of risk reduction, preparation, and execution.

The Risk Officer is accountable for managing the risk management application, sponsoring risk identification activities, helping ideas during the execution of the risk management process, and assuring the Risk Register is prepared and the ranks assigned to risks. The Risk Officer is liable for administering the Project Manager with support and status about risk actions.

**3. Budget and schedule:**

The final aim when combining risk management into budget planning is to know the premises your budget is based upon.

Risk assessing a complete budget may look like a heavy task, but the perfect way of action when discussing the risks of any further process is to divide it into sections and take those with the greatest possible impact. Risk management team holds the budget and schedule in control on a regular base so as to take quick response on those risks and check from additional loss.

**4. Risk categories:**

In a project, the different categories of risks are strategic risk, technical risk, financial risk, market risk, compliance risk and many more.

**5. Risk probability and impact:**

Probability: Risk is an issue that has a chance of happening. The probability of it occurring can differ wherever from just over zero percent to just under a hundred percent.

Impact – Risk, by its very category, eternally has a adverse impact. But, the scope of the impact alters in words of cost and impact on health, human life, or some other important part.

**6. Risk documentation:**

Everything about documentation is saved in drive and updated periodically. Hard copies are shared during meetings within the team. We used soft copies for easy operation during our project.

**Risk Register**

This is a screenshot of risk register sheet

![](risk.png)

## Risk Mitigation

**05/28/2020**

**Project Name:** E-Pharma

As more project risks are identified throughout the project, they will be accessed by the Project Manager and Team Lead, and together with the project team will develop avoidance and mitigation strategies. These risks are used to update the Risk Register and the risk management plan to ensure these risks are being monitored in timely fashion and are responded to accordingly.

Both identified and future occurring project risks will be managed and controlled within the constraints of time, scope, and cost. The Project Manager, with the assistance of the Team lead will determine the best way to respond to each risk to ensure compliance with these constraints.

In worst case scenarios it may be necessary to allow flexibility to one of the project&#39;s constraints. If necessary, funding may be added to the project to allow for more resources in order to meet the project schedule and scope requirements. Time and scope are rigid project constraints and no flexibility. However, cost constraint will only be allowed to be flexible in extreme cases where no other risk avoidance or mitigation strategy will work.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

| **Risk Rank** | **Major Risks** | **Strategies to mitigate risks** | **Responsibility** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Market Risk | Reviewing all the similar project in the market and should be calculated numerically | Project manager |
| 2 | Financial Risk | Allocating excess cost for the project for future financial problems. | Project Manager |
| 3 | Technical Risk | Emphasizing team support.Increasing the frequency of project monitoringImproving problem handling skills | Program manager and team lead |
| 4 | People Risk | Recruiting employees from diversified areas. | Project Manager 
| 5 | Structure process risk | Selecting most experienced project manager.Increasing the frequency of monitoring.Defining all the objectives clearly. | Project manager

## Procurement Management Plan

**Date:** 06/03/2020

**Project Name** : E-Pharma

**Guidelines on Types of Contracts:**

**Types of Contracts: -**

There are generally 3 types of bilateral (signed by 2 parties) contracts:

1. Cost reimbursable (or Cost Plus)
2. Fixed price
3. Time and Material contracts.

Cost reimbursable (or Cost Plus) Cost reimbursable (CR) contracts involve payment based on sellers&#39; actual costs as well as a fee or incentive for meeting or exceeding project objectives. Therefore, the buyer bears the highest cost risk.

Fixed Price Contracts Fixed price (FP) contracts (also called lump-sum contracts) involve a predetermined fixed price for the product and are used when the product is well defined. Therefore, the seller bears a higher burden of the cost risk than the buyer.

Time and Material Contracts

Time and material (T&amp;M) contracts (sometimes called Unit Price Contracts) contain characteristics of both fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts and are generally used for small project cost amounts. These contracts may be priced on a per-hour or per-item basis (fixed price) but the total number of hours or items is not determined (open-ended cost type arrangements like CR contracts). T&amp;M contracts are often used for staff augmentation, acquisition of experts and any outside support, when a precise statement of work cannot be quickly prescribed. A Purchase Order is a simple form of unit price contract that is often used for buying commodities. It is a unilateral contract and only signed by 1 party instead of the above bilateral contracts that are signed by both parties.

**Few Tips: -**

| **Contract Type** | **Priorities ( Least to Important )** |
| --- | --- |
| Costs plus fixed fee(CPFF) | Cost, Time, Performance |
| Costs plus award fee (CPAF) | Cost, Time, Performance |
| Costs plus incentive fee_ ** ** _(CPIF) | Time, Performance, Cost |
| Time and material (T&amp;M) | Performance, Time, Cost |
| Fixed price plus incentive fee_ ** ** _ (FPIF) | Time, Performance, Cost |
| Fixed Price Contracts (FP) | Cost, Time, Performance |

**Standard procurement documents or templates:**

**Types of Procurement Documents**

A few types of procurement documents are:

- **RFP -**  A request for proposal is an early stage in a procurement process issuing an invitation for suppliers, often through a bidding process, to submit a proposal on a specific commodity or service.
- **RFI -**  A request for information (RFI) is a proposal requested from a potential seller or a service provider to determine what products and services are potentially available in the marketplace to meet a buyer&#39;s needs and to know the capability of a seller in terms of offerings and strengths of the seller.
- **RFQ -**  A request for quotation (RFQ) is used when discussions with bidders are not required (mainly when the specifications of a product or service are already known) and when price is the main or only factor in selecting the successful bidder.
- **Solicitations:**  These are invitations of bids, requests for quotations and proposals. These may serve as a binding contract.
- **Offers -**  This type of procurement documents are bids, proposals and quotes made by potential suppliers to prospective clients.
- **Contracts -**  Contracts refer to the final signed agreements between clients and suppliers.
- **Amendments/Modifications -**  This refers to any changes in solicitations, offers and contracts. Amendments/Modifications have to be in the form of a written document.

**Guidelines for creating procurement documents** :

- **Information Gathering -**  A potential customer first researches suppliers, who satisfy requirements for the product needed.
- **Supplier Contact -**  When a prospective supplier has been identified, the customer requests for quotations, proposals, information and tender. This may be done through advertisements or through direct contact with the supplier.
- **Background Review -**  The customer now examines references for the goods/services concerned and may also consider samples of the goods/services or undertake trials.
- **Negotiation -**  Next the negotiations regarding price, availability and customization options are undertaken. The contract regarding the purchase of the goods or services is completed.
- **Fulfilment -**  Based on the contract signed, the purchased goods or services are shipped and delivered. Payment is also completed at this stage. Additional training or installation of the product may also be provided.
- **Renewal -**  Once the goods or services are consumed or disposed of and the contract has expired, the product or service needs to be re-ordered. The customer now decides whether to continue with the same supplier or look for a new one.
